# Pig_Latin
The pigLatin.py program is a program which uses several  recursive algorithms to produce a sequence of words in  "Pig Latin" from an initial string in "Snake Case".  A string that is written in "Snake Case" uses only lowercase  letters and each word is separated by an underscore. Any word  can be written in "Pig Latin" by removing all the characters  in the word (starting from the left and moving to the right,  up to but not including the leftmost vowel(specifically one  of "A", "E", "I", "O", or "U") contained in the word. Without changing their order, these characters must be appended to the  end of the word, and then the characters "AY" must be appended  to the end of that.
